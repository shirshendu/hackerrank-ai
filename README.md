=============

My experiments in learning AI through HackerRank.com

- Code for each puzzle is kept in monolithic files, but that is because of the way hackerrank expects it to be: in one large script.
- The bot.rb is the one that solves the puzzle.
- environment.rb and \*\_test.rb aren't needed for hackerrank; they are there to speed up development by running a test case for the bot, and keeping tracking the environment for it.
- Fully observable with small grid size and partially observable work well.
- Still needs a lot of optimization to work at an acceptable speed for the generic fully-observable grid.
